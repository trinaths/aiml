Business case
===========

Build a classifier model to predict the survival of passenger for titanic data set. 

Prepare a Python notebook to run the below mentioned Python steps on the given data set Download data set. Please read the instructions carefully.   

#. Import Libraries/Data set (1 point)
* Import the required libraries and the dataset
* Data Visualisation and Augmentation (0.5*6 = 3 points)
#. Plot at least two EDA graphs (use matplotlib/seaborn/any other library)
* Prepare data to be able to build a classification model
* Bring the train and test data in the required format
* Perform missing values check
* Perform scaling of data
* Print the shapes of train and test data
#. Naïve Bayes Model Building (0.5*3 = 1.5 points)
* Build a Naïve bayes classification model
* Train the model on the train data set 
* Print the model summary
* SVM Model Building (0.5*3 = 1.5 points)
* Build an SVM classification model
* Train the model on the train data set 
* Print the model summary
#. Model Evaluation (1 + 1 = 2 points)
* Check the Naïve bayes model’s performance by printing accuracy, confusion matrix, F1 score and AUC-ROC curve
* Check the SVM model’s performance by printing accuracy, confusion matrix, F1 score and AUC-ROC curve 
* Compare the performances of SVM and Naïve bayes models for the titanic dataset (1 point)
